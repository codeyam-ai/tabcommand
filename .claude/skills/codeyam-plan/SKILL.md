# Plan a Feature or Bug Fix

Investigate the codebase and create a structured plan file ready for the codeyam editor workflow.

## Critical Rule: Plan Only — Never Implement

**You are a planner, not an implementer.** Your job is to write a `.codeyam/plans/*.md` file describing what to change and why. You must NEVER:

- Edit, create, or modify source code files (`.ts`, `.tsx`, `.rs`, `.json`, etc.)
- Run `cargo`, `npm`, `vitest`, `tsc`, or any build/test command
- Make fixes, refactors, or "quick improvements" to the codebase
- Apply the plan you just wrote

Even if the fix is obvious and small, **write it in the plan and stop.** The user will execute the plan later through the editor workflow. If you catch yourself about to edit a source file, stop and put that change into the plan's Implementation section instead.

**One capability, one boundary:** a bug plan MAY *capture* a failing reproduction test as source-code text inside the plan file itself (`.codeyam/plans/<slug>.md`, in the `## Reproduction Test` section documented in Step 5). This is still just writing the plan file — you MUST NOT write that test into the real test tree, MUST NOT run any test, and MUST NOT edit any file outside `.codeyam/`. The test is captured as text only; the editor workflow materializes and runs it at execution time.

The only files you may write are:
- `.codeyam/plans/<slug>.md` (the plan itself)
- `git add` / `git commit` of that plan file (and **only** that plan file — never `git add -A`, never a bare `git commit` that would sweep in unrelated staged work). This is the plan-creation commit specifically — it must contain only the plan file. The feature-commit step at the end of the editor workflow has a different rule: it auto-commits all non-gitignored leftovers.

The one read-only CLI call this skill makes is `codeyam-editor editor plan-prefixes` in Step 2 (to offer every prefix used before as a one-click option). It prints to stdout and changes nothing — it is not an "implementation" command.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Ask what to build or fix

**Do NOT use the AskUserQuestion tool for this step.** AskUserQuestion is a structured multiple-choice tool — using it here will produce a menu, which is exactly what we don't want. Instead, output the question below as plain assistant text and stop, waiting for the user's reply in the next turn.

Output **exactly** this and nothing else (no preamble, no tool calls, no follow-up options):

> **What do you want to build or fix?**
>
> Describe the feature, enhancement, or bug in as much detail as you'd like.

Then end your turn. The user will reply with a freeform description.

Take the user's response as the plan basis and move to the name-prefix step (Step 2), then on to investigation. Only ask a follow-up question if the response is genuinely ambiguous (e.g., you can't tell which part of the codebase is involved). Never ask about type, scope, priority, or any other categorization — infer those from the description and the codebase.

### Step 2: Ask about a name prefix

A prefix tags the plan's filename and title by author or work item — developer initials (`jc`), a feature code (`auth`), or a ticket number (`PROJ-123`). The question is **always** a one-click `AskUserQuestion` menu, so the user never has to type a prefix to answer it:

1. Run `codeyam-editor editor plan-prefixes` and capture its trimmed, newline-delimited stdout as `priorPrefixes` (an ordered list, most-recent-first). It prints every distinct prefix any plan has used (scanning both the queue and `.codeyam/plans/completed/`), de-duplicated, or nothing when no plan carries a prefix — or there are no plans yet. The first line equals the legacy `last-plan-prefix` output.

2. **Always** use `AskUserQuestion` — there is no plain-text fallback branch:
   - Question: "Would you like to prefix the plan's filename and title?"
   - One option per entry in `priorPrefixes`, in order, **capped at the 3 most-recent** (an `AskUserQuestion` menu allows at most 4 options and the last slot is reserved for "None"). Mark the **first** option "(Recommended)" with description = "Reuse the prefix from your most recent plan."; give the rest description = "Reuse a prefix you've used before."
   - A final option: label = "None", description = "No prefix — derive the filename and title from the description alone."
   - The auto-injected **Other** field lets the user type any prefix not shown (including one beyond the 3-most-recent cap).

   When `priorPrefixes` is empty, the menu still renders with just the "None" option (plus the **Other** field) — so the question is always answerable with a single click and the user is never forced to type.

   Interpret the answer: a listed prefix → that prefix; "None" → no prefix; an **Other** reply → the trimmed typed value as the prefix.

3. Strip any double-quote (`"`) characters from the resulting prefix before carrying it into the "Write the plan file" step (Step 5), so both the `title:` and the new `prefix:` frontmatter lines stay valid YAML.

Then move on to investigation (Step 3).

### Step 3: Investigate the codebase

Based on the user's description, explore the relevant parts of the codebase to understand:

1. **Where the change lives** — which files, components, modules, or crates are involved
2. **How things currently work** — read the relevant code to understand current behavior
3. **What needs to change** — identify the specific modifications, new files, or new components needed
4. **What to reuse** — find existing helpers, components, types, or patterns that should be leveraged
5. **What tests exist** — check for existing test coverage in the affected areas
6. **Bug or feature?** — classify the request as a **bug fix** (some current
   behavior is broken and you can state the correct expected behavior) vs a
   **feature/enhancement**. Only bug fixes get a `## Reproduction Test` section
   in Step 5. For a bug, note which existing test file (if any) already covers
   the affected code — that is where the reproduction test will live.

**Always check the project's registries and glossary first** — they are the
authoritative index of reusable code in a codeyam project. Skipping these is
what produces generic "look at the codebase" plans the editor workflow has
to re-research at the `explore` slug:

- `codeyam-editor editor glossary-find <name>` (flags: `--prefix`,
  `--substring`, `--feature`, `--format`) — look up named entries
- `codeyam-editor editor glossary-list` / `glossary-untested` /
  `glossary-by-tag <tag>` — projections across the whole table
- `.codeyam/glossary-index.txt` — line-oriented, greppable sidecar; safe to
  Read or grep directly. Use this when you need to scan for similar names
  or topics rather than look up a known entry
- `.codeyam/test-registry.json` — every registered test, its file, and the
  glossary entries it exercises. Use it to find which tests cover the
  area you're about to touch
- `.codeyam/deps-index.txt` — line-oriented projection of
  `dependency-graph.json`. Use it to find which functions/components
  call into the area you're touching, and what already exists nearby
  that you might reuse

NEVER `Read` `.codeyam/glossary.json` directly — it exceeds the Read tool
limit. Use the CLI / index sidecar.

After the registry/glossary pass, use the Explore agent or direct
Glob/Grep/Read tools to investigate code the indexes pointed you at. Be
thorough — the plan quality depends on understanding the codebase.

**Constrained-file pre-check.** Once investigation has produced the
candidate file list, run it through the editor so the plan never invites an
edit the guards will reject:

```bash
codeyam-editor editor classify-constrained-files <path>... --format json
```

It returns only the constrained files (unconstrained paths are dropped),
each tagged with one or both of:

- **`leanContract`** — a SKILL.md governed by an enforced max-line-count
  test (`skill_md_is_lean`). When `atLimit` is true, additions fail that
  test, so the plan must NOT schedule new lines there. Route the new
  guidance to a step `.txt` file under
  `crates/codeyam-editor/src/commands/editor/steps/library/` and name that
  file in the plan. Reductions (refactors that shrink the file) stay fine.
- **`agentConfig`** — a file the harness reads as instructions/settings
  (`.claude/`, `.gemini/`, `ui/.claude/`, `settings.json`, keybindings).
  Edits trip the auto-mode self-modification guard. If the plan genuinely
  needs the change, confirm with the user once (Step 4) that it's an
  authorized agent-config edit before writing it into the plan; otherwise
  route the intent elsewhere.

Surfacing these at plan time avoids the costly discover-at-edit-time cycle —
a full test run to reveal a lean-limit failure, plus a confusing self-mod
denial mid-implementation.

**Reminder: investigation means reading, not changing.** Use only Read, Grep, Glob, and Explore tools here. Do not edit any files during investigation.

### Step 4: Clarify scope

Based on what you found in investigation, ask 1-2 targeted clarifying questions using AskUserQuestion. These should be **specific questions that emerged from reading the code**, not generic planning questions.

Good questions:
- "I found that X and Y are tightly coupled — should both be in scope, or just X?"
- "The current implementation uses pattern A, but pattern B would be simpler here. Which do you prefer?"
- "This change touches the API layer — should we include backend changes, or keep it frontend-only?"

**Skip this step entirely** if the request is unambiguous and investigation answered all questions. Don't ask questions for the sake of asking — only when the answer genuinely affects the plan.

### Step 5: Write the plan file

Create `.codeyam/plans/<slug>.md` using the Write tool.

**Slug:** Derive from the title — lowercase, alphanumeric + hyphens only. Example: "Session Recovery UX" becomes `session-recovery-ux.md`.

- **With a name prefix** (from Step 2): prepend the slugified prefix joined to
  the base title with a **double hyphen** (`--`) —
  `<slugify(prefix)>--<slugify(base title)>`. Slugify each half the same way
  (lowercase, alphanumeric + hyphens) and join the two halves with `--`, so the
  prefix boundary stays visible in the filename even when the prefix itself
  contains a single hyphen. Example: prefix `PROJ-123` + title "Dark Mode
  Toggle" → `proj-123--dark-mode-toggle.md`.
- **Without a prefix**: derive from the title exactly as above. Example: title
  "Dark Mode Toggle" → `dark-mode-toggle.md`.

**Plan file format:**

```markdown
---
title: "Feature Name"
mode: ui
createdAt: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"
source: manual
---

## Summary

One-paragraph description of what to build or fix and why.

## Key Decisions

- Decision 1 — why this approach
- Decision 2 — what was considered and why this was chosen

## Implementation

### 1. First change

**File**: `path/to/file.ext`

Description of what to change and why.

### 2. Second change

**New file**: `path/to/new-file.ext`

Description of what this new file does.

## Reused existing code

- `helperName` from `path/to/helper.ts` (glossary entry: `helperName`)
- `ComponentName` from `path/to/Component.tsx` (glossary entry: `ComponentName`)

Cite registry / glossary entries by name when the plan reuses them. This is
what makes the plan "well-researched" enough for the editor workflow's Plan
and Explore steps to fast-path through to Confirm.

## Reproduction Test

<!-- BUG FIXES ONLY. Omit this whole section for feature/enhancement plans. -->

One sentence naming the buggy behavior this test pins.

**Target**: `path/to/real/test-file.ext` — run with
`codeyam-editor editor refresh-tests --test <name>`.

```ts
// New test: a `//` (or `///` for Rust) description comment is mandatory.
it("returns the merged total for overlapping ranges", () => {
  expect(mergeRanges([[1, 3], [2, 5]])).toEqual([[1, 5]]);
});
```

Status: PROPOSED — confirm red at execution. Expected failure: `mergeRanges`
returns `[[1, 3], [2, 5]]`, so the `toEqual([[1, 5]])` assertion fails.

## Scenarios to Demonstrate

- Happy path with realistic data
- Empty state
- Edge case 1
- Edge case 2
```

**Frontmatter fields:**
- `title` (required) — Feature name. Becomes the `--feature` value in the editor.
  **With a name prefix** (from Step 2), write it as `"<prefix> -- <base title>"`:
  the prefix verbatim (as the user typed it, with any double-quotes stripped), a
  space, a double hyphen, a space, then the base title. The ` -- ` delimiter
  makes the prefix visually distinct from the title (far harder to miss than a
  bare colon). The prefix is kept readable here — only the filename slug
  normalizes it. Example: prefix `PROJ-123` + "Dark Mode Toggle" →
  `title: "PROJ-123 -- Dark Mode Toggle"`. **Without a prefix**, it's just the
  feature name, e.g. `title: "Dark Mode Toggle"`.
- `mode` (required) — `"ui"` or `"backend"`. Default to `"ui"` unless the change is purely backend.
- `createdAt` (required) — ISO 8601 UTC timestamp of when the plan was created.
- `source` (required) — Always `"manual"` for this skill.
- `prefix` (optional) — The author/work-item prefix, written **verbatim** (any
  double-quotes stripped) when Step 2 produced one. This is the canonical record
  of the prefix — `editor plan-prefixes` (and `editor last-plan-prefix`) read it
  back to seed the next plan's options. The title's ` -- ` separator is NOT
  parsed to recover the prefix (a title could legitimately contain ` -- `),
  which is why the prefix is stored explicitly here. **Omit the line entirely
  when no prefix was chosen.**
- `order` (optional) — Positive integer. Controls queue position in the Plan tab.
  Missing/tied plans fall back to ascending `createdAt` (first-created first).
  Usually set via the UI drag or `editor plan-reorder`, not written by hand.
- `dependsOn` (optional) — Array of plan slugs this plan depends on, e.g.
  `dependsOn: ["session-recovery-ux", "auth-rewrite"]`. The Plan tab gates Run
  on this plan until each listed plan has been completed (i.e. archived under
  `.codeyam/plans/completed/`). Use the bracket-array form; a bare scalar
  (`dependsOn: foo`) is also accepted and parsed as a single-element list.

**Worked example (prefixed):** prefix `PROJ-123` + title "Dark Mode Toggle"
produces these coupled lines / paths — note the ` -- ` in the title and the
`--` join in the slug:

```
file:   .codeyam/plans/proj-123--dark-mode-toggle.md
title:  "PROJ-123 -- Dark Mode Toggle"
prefix: "PROJ-123"
```

**When to use `dependsOn`:** if the user's request is too big to deliver in
one plan and you split it into multiple plans, declare dependencies on the
prerequisites instead of relying on queue order alone. Reference the slugs
of plans you've authored in the same session — they exist in
`.codeyam/plans/`. The user can then run them in any order; the editor
will block Run on a downstream plan until its prerequisites land.

**The `## Reproduction Test` section (bug fixes only):**

Add this section **only** when the plan is a bug fix *and* a targeted failing
test is genuinely writable from reading the codebase. Its job is to hand the
editor workflow a red-first reproduction it can materialize verbatim. Shape:

- **One sentence** stating the buggy behavior the test pins.
- **Target** — the real test file path where execution should place or modify
  the test, plus the run command `codeyam-editor editor refresh-tests --test
  <name>`. Never hand-write a `cargo test` / `vitest` invocation; the language,
  extension, and runner come from the *target file's* stack, not a default.
- **New test** → a fenced code block with the full test, including the
  mandatory `//` (or `///` for Rust) description comment directly above the
  `it()` / `#[test]` — the rule the audit enforces.
- **Change to an existing test** → name the existing test and give a fenced
  unified-diff (or before/after) showing the assertion flip that turns it red,
  so execution can apply it exactly.
- **Status** — `Status: PROPOSED — confirm red at execution`, plus the expected
  failure (which assertion fails and roughly what message). You cannot run the
  test (the critical rule), so confirming the red is the execution workflow's
  job, not yours.
- **When no reproduction test is writable** (visual/layout regressions, bugs
  needing live runtime state), still include the section but record a one-line
  *reason* instead of fabricating a weak test — e.g. *"Visual regression — no
  isolatable unit repro; demonstrate via scenario 'empty dashboard'."* An honest
  "no unit-level repro" beats a fake red.

**Guidelines for plan content:**
- Focus on **what the user will see and do**, not just implementation details
- For a **bug fix**, capture a `## Reproduction Test` (see above) that isolates
  the bug's root cause, stays minimal, and matches the target file's stack — no
  hardcoded runner or extension. Skip the section entirely for features.
- Be specific about file paths — you investigated the codebase, so name real files
- List concrete scenarios with interesting data states (empty, rich, error, edge cases)
- Keep the summary concise — the editor's Step 1 will refine details
- For bug fixes, describe the current broken behavior and the expected correct behavior
- Reference real existing code that should be reused — include file paths
- Honor Step 3's constrained-file pre-check: never leave a section as "edit
  SKILL.md" for a lean file at its limit — name the step `.txt` file the
  guidance should live in instead, and call out any authorized agent-config
  edit explicitly so the editor workflow isn't surprised by the self-mod guard

### Step 6: Present and confirm

Run `codeyam-editor editor plans` to verify the plan is parseable and shows up correctly.

Show the user a brief summary of the plan, then use AskUserQuestion with these options:
- **"Looks good, commit it" (Recommended)** — Commit the plan and finish
- **"I want changes"** — User describes changes, you revise the plan, then re-present
- **"Discard and start over"** — Delete the plan file and go back to Step 1

### Step 7: Act on response

- **Looks good** — Commit the plan, then signal the UI.

  **Commit hygiene:** the plan commit must contain only `.codeyam/plans/<slug>.md`. Use the pathspec form below — do not run a bare `git commit`, since other files may be staged from prior work. (This is the plan-creation commit specifically — it must contain only the plan file. The feature-commit step at the end of the editor workflow has a different rule: it auto-commits all non-gitignored leftovers.) After committing, verify with `git show --stat HEAD` that only the plan file is listed; if anything else appears, run `git reset --soft HEAD~1` and retry with the pathspec form.

  **Always append `[skip ci]` to the commit message.** Plan files don't change source or tests, so CI must not be triggered. This is non-optional — apply it on the initial commit and on any amend.

  The plan file is brand-new and untracked, so it must be staged before the
  pathspec commit — `git commit -- <pathspec>` only commits *already-tracked*
  changes and fails with `pathspec ... did not match any file(s) known to git`
  on a new file. Stage the single plan file first (this does not violate the
  "only the plan file — never `git add -A`" guarantee; the pathspec commit
  still scopes the commit to that one file).

  ```bash
  git add .codeyam/plans/<slug>.md
  git commit -m "plan: <short description of the feature/fix> [skip ci]" -- .codeyam/plans/<slug>.md
  git show --stat --name-only HEAD   # verify only the plan file is in the commit
  codeyam-editor editor plan-complete
  ```
  After the commit succeeds, `plan-complete` triggers a confirmation modal
  in the Plan tab offering to start another plan or return to the queued
  changes list. Only run `plan-complete` on this branch — not on "I want
  changes" (which loops back to Step 6) or "Discard" (which returns to
  Step 1 with no plan saved).
- **I want changes** — Make the requested changes to the plan file, then go back to Step 6
- **Discard** — Delete the plan file and return to Step 1

## Tips

- Spend most of your time in Step 3 (investigation). A plan based on real codebase understanding is far more valuable than a generic one.
- If the feature touches multiple areas, organize the Implementation section by area, not by order of execution.
- Plans with `mode: backend` will suggest backend mode when selected in the editor.
- Don't over-specify implementation — leave room for the editor workflow to make tactical decisions. Focus on the "what" and "why", with enough "how" to be actionable.
